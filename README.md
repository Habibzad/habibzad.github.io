## Hey, :wave:

I’m Ahmad! I am a front-end developer based in Rockville, Maryland.

Coding and reading are my favorite ways of spending my time.

I build static websites and small web applications, while I continue to learn and improve my skills every day.

I write standards-based code that is semantic, accessible, easy to maintain, and cross browser compatible.
