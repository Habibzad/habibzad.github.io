## 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝙼𝚎

Hi, I’m Ahmad! I am a front-end developer based in Rockville, Maryland.

Coding and reading are my favorite ways of spending my time.

I started coding as a hobby because I have a passion for building things and experimenting with new technologies, but I quickly realized that it was something I could see myself doing as a job as well.

I build static websites and small web applications, while I continue to learn and improve my skills every single day.

I write standards-based code that is semantic, accessible, easy to maintain, and cross browser compatible.
